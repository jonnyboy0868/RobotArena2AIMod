<p class="tutorial_title">Mobility Tutorial</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Well, you gotta be able to move around the arena right? 
  This tutorial covers some of the common ways you can build and wire your robot 
  for easy driving. Of course, you can do just about anything you want to make 
  your bot move. You don't even need to use wheels if you don't want to. But for 
  now, we'll just be talking about wheeled robots. There are numerous possibilities 
  for how you set up your wheels: 2 wheels, 4 wheels, powered steering unit, wheels 
  kept internal or placed external, etc. You'll probably discover many variations 
  on your own. I will get you started with a basic 2 wheeled bot to get you started.</p>
<p class="tutorial_note">Note: For this tutorial, we won't cover some of the basic 
  concepts like how to create a chassis. If you don't know how to use the workshop 
  to build a chassis and place components, you might want to read the first tutorial 
  on basic construction before reading this one.</p>
<p class="tutorial_heading">2-Wheeled Bots</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheelers.jpg" width="600" height="197"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Two wheeled bots are one of the easiest types of robots 
  to build and wire. This is a common design seen in AI bots like Stinger, Wide 
  Load, Flame Chopper, and LugNut. The basic principle is to set up two spin motors 
  facing the opposite direction from one another and attach wheels to those motors. 
  The steering technique is accomplished through wiring. Each motor is turning 
  either clockwise or counterclockwise. When the wheels rotate together the bot 
  goes forward, when they turn in opposite directions the bot steers left or right. 
  Lets build a quick one.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"> In the workshop, build a new robot and use any chassis 
  shape, but make sure it is large enough to hold two spin motors, a battery, 
  and control board. My shape is shown below.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheel_outline.gif" width="200" height="220"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Go to the components menu and place two spin motors on 
  the baseplate facing opposite directions. Remember that holding the SHIFT key 
  while placing a component will let you rotate it. I used the Red Bird motor 
  here, but you can use another spin motor if you want. Just make sure the axles 
  point outward from the center of the bot. Although the body of a spinmotor cannot 
  pass through the walls of the chassis, the axles can. This helps you to place 
  wheels externally.</p>
<p class="tutorial_note"> Note: If you wanted, you could keep the motors and axles 
  completely inside the chassis so that when you put a wheel on the axle it is 
  guarded inside the walls of the chassis. You need to ensure there is enough 
  room for the motor/axle AND the wheel, of course.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheel_motors.jpg" width="400" height="228"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">The next step is simply to place wheels on the axles 
  of the spin motors. You will find that the various wheels have different diameters 
  and some may not be large enough to use with certain spin motor setups. For 
  example, the mini wheel is too small to use with the Z-Tek motor because it 
  can't reach the ground.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheel_wheels.jpg" width="400" height="228"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">If I test my robot now, the front end will fall to the 
  ground since it has no support to balance it. You might want this effect for 
  some designs, but for this example, lets add a Balance Caster component to keep 
  the front of the bot level. I picked the 20 cm version of the caster. Some components 
  have styles like this to help fine-tune your robot. Note that the caster component 
  is placed on the bottom of the baseplate. You won't see it if you are viewing 
  from the top.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheel_caster.jpg" width="400" height="228"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Go ahead and put a battery and controlboard somewhere 
  inside the bot. We will need these if we want to be able to wire and drive the 
  bot.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheel_battery.jpg" width="400" height="228"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Go to the Wiring setup screen. We will be using two analog 
  controls for this robot. Remember that analog controls have two inputs: one 
  positive and one negative. This is ideal for driving setups because we have 
  opposing directions. So we will use one analog control for the Forward-Reverse 
  directions and another analog control for Left-Right steering.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheel_analog.jpg" width="400" height="228"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">It is frequently helpful to give names to your controls. 
  For the first analog input, you could call it &quot;Forward-Back.&quot; Click 
  the input boxes and assign two keys from your keyboard that will be used for 
  control input. My example uses <b>W</b> and <b>S</b>. Or you might press two 
  directions on a gamepad or joystick if you are using that style of input.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheel_analog_input.jpg" width="300" height="191"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Now you need to wire the Forward-Back control to your 
  spinmotors. Rotate your 3D view so you can easily see the two spin motors, and 
  so that UP would represent a forward direction for your bot to drive. With the 
  control selected in the grid, click on the right spin motor. You will get a 
  dialog box asking how to wire the motor. For the right motor, wire it so that 
  positive is clockwise and negative is counter-clockwise. Click OK when you have 
  done this.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2_wheel_cw_ccw.jpg" width="300" height="210"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">You have wired one motor for Forward-Back, now wire the 
  other one. With the same Forward-Back analog control still selected in the grid, 
  click the left spin motor. This motor will be wired <i>opposite</i> of the right 
  motor, since it faces the opposite direction. Wire this one so that positive 
  is counter-clockwise and negative is clockwise. </p>
<p class="tutorial_body">If you think about it, it makes sense: pressing the forward 
  input key (my example is &quot;W&quot;) sends positive input to the control. 
  Positive is wired so that the right motor spins clockwise and the left motor 
  spins counter-clockwise. Imagine the wheels spinning in this fashion and you 
  can see that the bot would drive forward. Pressing the other input key (&quot;S&quot; 
  in my case) sends negative input which spins the wheels the opposite direction 
  causing the bot to drive in reverse. Try it out by going to the test garage 
  (click &quot;Test Robot&quot;) if you want to see how the bot drives so far.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">OK. We have forward and reverse. Now we need to be able 
  to steer the robot. Steering is easy to set up. Drag another analog control 
  onto the controller grid and name it &quot;Left-Right&quot; and assign some 
  input keys. Since I used <b>W</b> and <b>S</b> for forward/reverse, I might 
  choose <b>A</b> and <b>D</b> for left and right. Then, with that analog control 
  selected, you will wire each spin motor identically: positive is clockwise, 
  negative is counter-clockwise. Again, think about what is happening here. Pressing 
  the &quot;Left&quot; input sends a positive control signal. Positive is wired 
  so that each motor spins clockwise. If the right motor spins clockwise, it will 
  push the right side of the bot forward. If the left motor spins clockwise, it 
  will push the left side backward. When the right side goes forward and the left 
  side goes backward, the resulting motion is a rotation of the entire bot chassis 
  in the left direction.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/2w_mobility_diagram.gif" width="318" height="300" align="left">If 
  it helps, here is a diagram of your wiring. It shows how each analog control 
  is wired to each spin motor.</p>
<p class="tutorial_note">Remember that terms like &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; 
  are dependent on your viewpoint. This assumes you are looking at the bot from 
  the top down and that UP in the view would match the robot's forward direction.</p>

<p class="tutorial_heading">4-Wheeled Bots</p>
<p class="tutorial_heading"><img src="images/mobility/4_wheelers.jpg" width="600" height="200"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">The good news here is that once you understand the principles 
  of the 2-wheeled wiring, a 4-wheeled bot is nearly identical. Instead of just 
  one motor facing each direction, set up two on each side of the bot. Motors 
  on the right side of the bot are wired the same as one another. Motors on the 
  left side are wired the same as one another.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">You have the added option here of using 4-wheel drive 
  or 2-wheel drive, and 4-wheel steering or 2-wheel steering. With a lightweight 
  bot and powerful spin motors, you might find that having all 4 motors wired 
  for steering is too powerful and your bot spins too fast. In this case you could 
  use all four motors for driving forward and reverse, but use only the front 
  two motors for steering.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">With the diagram below, assuming up is the forward direction 
  of the robot, see if you can wire the two analog controls to the four spin motors 
  to get this 4-wheeled bot to drive properly. The motors and controls are labeled 
  and the solution is given following the illustration.</p>

<p class="tutorial_heading"><img src="images/mobility/ps_preview.jpg" width="141" height="96" align="left">Powered 
  Steering Component </p>
<p class="tutorial_body">The Powered Steering component is a single component 
  that you place on your chassis baseplate to make it easier to set up and wire 
  the bot for driving. The component has two axles with rotating hubs, and wiring 
  connections for forward, reverse, left, and right. It typically needs to be 
  used on a four-wheeled robot because it mimics the type of steering on a car, 
  with moveable rotors for directing the angle of the wheels. This is different 
  from the style of steering you used above where you wired one motor to go forward 
  and the other to go in reverse in order to steer the robot. This part of the 
  tutorial will walk you through using the Powered Steering component.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Build a chassis that would be suitable for a four-wheeled 
  design. Something sort of rectangular would work, but remember that you can 
  make just about any shape you want as long as you can fit the components you 
  need into it. </p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/ps_chassis.jpg" width="400" height="223"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">With your chassis ready, go to the components screen 
  and pick the <i>mechanics</i> category. You will see the Powered Steering component 
  in the list. This component comes in three styles: narrow, medium, and wide, 
  depending on the size of your chassis. For the one I have built here, the narrow 
  style will fit best. Click to attach the component and place it in the front 
  of your chassis. Notice the blue triangular arrows on top of the component. 
  These indicate the forward direction, so place the component so the arrows point 
  towards the front of the bot.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/ps_component.jpg" width="400" height="217"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">The hexagonal hubs on each side are just like axles of 
  a spin motor. Go ahead and put wheels on these. You'll see they pop into place 
  easily.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/ps_wheels.jpg" width="400" height="217"> 
</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">To make this a four-wheeled bot, we need some wheels 
  in the back of the robot. You could place spin motors back there, but let's 
  make this example as easy as possible and use generic axle mounts. Axle mounts 
  are unpowered axles that can rotate freely--useful for extra support wheels. 
  These are found in the <i>extenders</i> category. Put one on each side in the 
  back, as my example shows.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/ps_axlemounts.jpg" width="400" height="216"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Your bot is nearly built. Pop a few wheels on these axle 
  mounts, then add a battery and control board. </p>
<p class="tutorial_note"><img src="images/mobility/ps_battery.jpg" width="200" height="200"></p>
<p class="tutorial_note">You may notice that the axle mounts are at a slightly 
  different height than the powered steering hubs. For that matter, each spin 
  motor is at a different height and each wheel is a different diameter, so mixing 
  and matching components may result in bots that are not perfectly level, but 
  that's ok. Remember you can also raise components up off the baseplate to adjust 
  how high they are positioned.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">For wiring, we will again use two analog controls. Remember 
  how to drag these onto your controller? Label one of them &quot;Forward-Back&quot; 
  and the other &quot;Left-Right&quot; if you want to remember what each one is 
  for. Assign keys or joystick inputs to these controls.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/powersteer_wiring.jpg" width="400" height="205"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">The actual wiring part is easy. Start with the &quot;Forward-Back&quot; 
  control, select it, and click on the Powered Steering component in the 3d view. 
  In the popup dialog, wire positive to &quot;Forward&quot; and negative to &quot;Backward.&quot; 
  Then click OK.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/powersteer_forwback.jpg" width="300" height="210"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Now, select the &quot;Left-Right&quot; analog control 
  and again click on the Powered Steering unit. This time, wire positive to &quot;Left&quot; 
  and negative to &quot;Right.&quot; Piece of cake, eh?</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/mobility/ps_leftright.jpg" width="300" height="210"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body">That's all there is to it. Try it out in the test garage 
  and you'll see that you can drive forward and reverse, and steer the wheels 
  left and right. Similar to a car, left and right by themselves simply rotate 
  the wheel angles. You have to be driving forward or backward while steering 
  if you want to turn.</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">There are many variations you can do with the powered 
  steering component. You could combine it with spin motors for added power. You 
  could use two powered steering components, one in front and one in the rear. 
  You could steer from the back of the bot. And so forth.</p>
