<p class="tutorial_title">Custom Texture Tutorial</p>
<p class="tutorial_body">Robot Arena 2 facilitates creating custom textures for 
  your robots, and this tutorial provides guidance on how you can do just that.</p>
<p class="tutorial_note">Note: For this tutorial, we won't cover some of the basic 
  concepts like how to create a chassis. If you don't know how to use the workshop 
  to build a chassis , you might want to read the first tutorial on basic construction 
  before reading this one.</p>

<p class="tutorial_heading">Creating Custom Decals</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><img src="images/texture/decals.jpg" width="440" height="240"></p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><strong>To add a custom decal texture to the game, follow 
  the instructions below.</strong></p>
<ul class="tutorial_body">
  <li> For a simple square decal, create the custom texture in your favorite image 
    editor (ie. Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, etc.) 
    <ul>
      <li> Adjust the image size so that it is 64 pixels by 64 pixels square</li>
      <li> Save the file as a 24-bit bitmap (bmp) file on your hard drive.</li>
      <li> Make sure there are NO spaces in the name. (ie. star.bmp, yellow_star.bmp)</li>
      <li> Copy the file to this folder in your Robot Arena 2 installation directory: 
        Infogrames\Robot Arena 2\Texture Library\decals\</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> To create a decal with an alpha channel, create the custom texture and 
    corresponding alpha channel in your favorite image editor (ie. Adobe Photoshop, 
    Corel Draw, etc.) 
    <ul>
      <li> Adjust the image size so that it is 64 pixels by 64 pixels square</li>
      <li> Save the file as a 32-bit targa (tga) file on your hard drive</li>
      <li> Make sure there are NO spaces in the name (ie. star.bmp, yellow_star.bmp)</li>
      <li> Copy the file to this folder in your Robot Arena 2 installation directory: 
        Infogrames\Robot Arena 2\Texture Library\decals\</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="tutorial_heading">Creating Custom Robot Textures</p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><strong>To create a custom texture for your robot and 
  import it into the game, follow the instructions below:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> <span class="tutorial_body">Create the chassis of your robot. Without the 
    chassis it will be impossible to do the next step.</span></li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Once the chassis is created you can proceed to the 
    Paint Shop section of the Robot Workshop.</li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> In the lower left hand corner there are two buttons 
    that are used for exporting and importing custom textures.</li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Click on the Export Paint Template. You will 
    then be given two choices: </span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="tutorial_body"> By default the exporter will simply export a 
        texture showing the texture areas used for the current chassis design. 
        Enter a name and the file will be saved in the Infogrames\Robot Arena 
        2\Custom Textures\ folder.</li>
      <li class="tutorial_body"> The other option is to create the base texture 
        within Robot Arena 2 using all of the Paint Shop tools, and then exporting 
        this texture for additional enhancements. In the exporter dialogue box 
        there is an option to &quot;Export the current chassis texture instead 
        of a template&quot;. By checking this option it will export out the texture 
        as a bmp and put it in the following folder: Infogrames\Robot Arena 2\Custom 
        Textures\ folder.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Now that you have either a template or a chassis 
    texture exported. Create or modify the texture in your favorite image editing 
    software.</li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Note: You can NOT alter the size of the texture to 
    be bigger or smaller. Doing so will create an invalid texture and cause problems 
    for the game.</li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Once you are happy with the texture, save the image. 
    If you moved the image to another folder for editing purposes then copy the 
    final bmp to this folder: Infogrames\Robot Arena 2\Custom Textures\</li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Now that you have the texture created, we can 
    now import the texture back into the game using the Import Custom Paint button. 
    Select the custom bitmap and click ok. Your chassis will now have the custom 
    texture applied to it.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="tutorial_heading">Creating a Texture Fill Texture</p>
<p class="tutorial_heading"><img src="images/texture/texturefill.jpg" width="440" height="250"></p>
<p class="tutorial_heading"><span class="tutorial_body">To create an addition 
  texture fill texture for the Paint Shop, follow the instructions below:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="tutorial_body">Create the texture using your favorite image editing 
    software. (ie. Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, etc.)</li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Adjust the size of the texture to be 256 pixels x 
    256 pixels.</li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Save the file as a 24-bit bitmap (bmp) file. 
    </span> 
    <ul>
      <li class="tutorial_body"> NOTE: You can NOT use spaces in the file name.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Copy the texture into this folder: Infogrames\Robot 
    Arena 2\Texture Library\</li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Now when you go into the Paint Shop, your texture 
    will be listed along with all of the other texture fill textures.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="tutorial_heading">Creating Surface Layer Textures</p>
<p><img src="images/texture/surface.jpg" width="440" height="243"><br>
  <br>
  <strong><span class="tutorial_body">To create additional surface layer textures 
  for the Paint Shop, follow the directions below:</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li class="tutorial_body">Using your favorite image editing software (ie. Adobe 
    Photoshop, Corel Draw, etc.) create a new texture with the size of 256 x 256 
    pixels.</li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Create the texture and the corresponding alpha channel 
    layer.</li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Save the file as a 32-bit Targa (tga) file.</li>
  <li class="tutorial_body"> Copy the file to this folder: Infogrames\Robot Arena 
    2\Texture Library\</li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body">Now the new surface layer texture will be in 
    the Paint Shop the next time you run Robot Arena 2.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="tutorial_heading">Creating Custom Edge Line Textures</span></p>
<p><img src="images/texture/edge.jpg" width="440" height="244"> </p>
<p class="tutorial_body"><strong>To create a custom edge line texture, follow 
  the directions below. This process is a little more advanced and you will need 
  to follow these directions closely.</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span class="tutorial_body">Using your favorite image editing software, 
    create a new texture with any of the sizes listed. The larger the texture 
    the more detail you can add:</span> 
    <ul>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> 16 x 16 pixels</span></li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> 32 x 32 pixels</span></li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> 64 x 64 pixels</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Once you have selected a size, create you edge 
    texture and the corresponding alpha texture layer.</span></li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Save the file as a 32-bit Targa (tga) file.</span></li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Copy this file to the following location: Infogrames\Robot 
    Arena 2\Texture Library\edges\</span></li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> From here you have to do some text editing 
    to setup the edge line texture to be used in the game</span></li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Create a new text file in the same folder you 
    just copied the texture to: Infogrames\Robot Arena 2\Texture Library\edges\ 
    And make sure that you give the text file the same name as the texture file!</span></li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Open the text file and add the following lines(This 
    is an example File.. your settings will differ from those below):</span> 
    <ul>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Filename: name_of_file.tga</span></li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Preview: name_of_preview.bmp</span></li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Length ratio (world pixels per file pixel): 
        .04</span></li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Width (world pixels): 8</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Below is a definition of each line in the text 
    file and what the settings mean. This will allow you to adjust these setting 
    according to your texture:</span> 
    <ul>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> <strong>Filename</strong>: This is the 
        name of the .tga file to use for the texture itself. Please use the included 
        .tga files as a guide in creating your own edge line textures. These are 
        found in the Texture Library\edges directory under the root install of 
        the game.</span></li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Preview: The filename of the preview bitmap 
        to use. Please use the included preview bitmaps as a guide in creating 
        your own previews. These are found in the Texture Library\edges directory 
        under the root install of the game.</span></li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> <strong>Length ratio</strong>: This value 
        determines how often the edge line texture will tile across the bot texture. 
        The number of tiles is determined by the following formula:</span> 
        <ul>
          <li><span class="tutorial_body"> Number of Tiles = Length Ratio * Pixels 
            on Bot texture. </span></li>
          <li><span class="tutorial_body"> This value can range from 0 (which 
            means no tiling) to less than 1 (Note: 1 would mean infinite tiling 
            so don't use that value). You should tweak this value until the visual 
            outcome is what you desire.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> <strong>Width</strong>: This value specifies 
        the width of the edge line and can range from 1 (a hardly noticeable edge 
        line) to 256 (an edge line that is huge). A good value to use is 24. Again, 
        tweak this value until you are satisfied with the result of your edge 
        line.</span></li>
      <li><span class="tutorial_body"> <strong>NOTE</strong>: Name the text file 
        similarly to the other text files in the directory, as this name is used 
        in the game interface.</span></li>
    </ul>
