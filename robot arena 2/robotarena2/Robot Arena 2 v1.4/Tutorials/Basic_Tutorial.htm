<H3 class="tutorial_title">Robot Workshop Basic Tutorial</H3>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">The robot workshop is where you create or modify your 
  robots. Every great robotics team has a well-stocked workshop with plenty of 
  robot parts and components, welding gear, grinders, and other tools to construct 
  that next superbot. The RA2 workshop has everything you need to build, wire, 
  and paint your robot to your specifications. Of course, none of the parts will 
  cost you a penny and you always put a perfect seam on your weld! The point here 
  is to build a great robot, not to manage your checkbook or hold a torch steady. 
</p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">So, let's go over the main parts of the workshop and 
  what you can do. You've probably already discovered that to get to the workshop, 
  you first need to have a robotics team formed. In Team HQ, under the <B>Robots</B> 
  menu choice, you have six slots for your robots. Double click any of the slots, 
  or select one and click the <B>Workshop</B> button in the lower right. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">You'll now see six buttons at the top of your screen: 
  Overview, Chassis, Components, Wiring, Paint Shop, and Test Robot. Clicking 
  on any of these will change your main view to work in each of those areas. You 
  can click them in any order, but some are dependent on others. For example, 
  you can't add components to your robot until you have a chassis; and you can't 
  wire your robot until you've added the control board component. You'll learn 
  how this works as you spend time in the workshop. </p>
<P></P>
<IMG height=32 alt="" 
src="images/basic/workshop_buttons.jpg" width=640> 
<H4 class="tutorial_heading">Overview</H4>
<IMG height=330 alt="" 
src="images/basic/workshop_overview.jpg" width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Most of the workshop areas will have a 3D view of your 
  robot on the left side of the screen, and some options or controls on the right 
  side. If you haven't built a robot chassis yet, you won't see anything in the 
  3D view. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">The <B>Overview</B> section lets you give a name to your 
  robot and shows you how much the bot currently weighs. You can also take a "snapshot" 
  of your robot, which will be used in other areas of the game as a preview of 
  the bot. You can rotate the 3D view by clicking and dragging in the window with 
  your right mouse button. You can also zoom using the mousewheel. This is true 
  of nearly any 3D view in the workshop. If you don't yet have a robot created, 
  of course, this does nothing. </p>
<H4 class="tutorial_heading">Chassis</H4>
<IMG height=330 alt="" 
src="images/basic/workshop_chassis.jpg" width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Your chassis is the main framework that makes up the 
  shape of your robot. Think about a car that has no wheels, engine, seats, or 
  gas tank. Take away all the stuff attached to the car and you are left with 
  the core chassis. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">The <B>Chassis</B> section of the workshop is where you 
  create the shape of your chassis, and select the armor material used to construct 
  it. You'll see a button to do each of these things on the main chassis screen. 
  Of course, you can't set an armor type if you haven't yet built the chassis. 
  Also note that building a chassis is a core part of creating your robot and 
  must be done before you can add components or other steps. And if you ever want 
  to change the shape of your chassis, you will lose any components that have 
  already been placed. After all, the guys in the machine shop can't exactly cut 
  and weld sheetmetal with a motor screwed into the thing, can they? </p>
<H5 class="tutorial_heading">Creating a Chassis Shape</H5>
<p class="tutorial_body">RA2 lets you be the designer when it comes to your chassis 
  shape. After clicking the <B>Structure Design</B> button from the Chassis screen, 
  you will be given a blank blueprint. (If you already had worked on a chassis 
  and are changing it, the blueprint will show your last chassis shape.) </p>
<P></P>
<IMG height=330 alt="" 
src="images/basic/workshop_chassis1.jpg" width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Step 1 of creating your chassis is to draw the outline 
  of your robot <I>baseplate</I>. This is the bottom of the robot, but it will 
  also be related to the top, as you'll see in step 2. Imagine you are looking 
  at the bot from the top down, and begin plotting points on the blueprint grid 
  to draw your outline. If you don't want to snap to grid lines, you can un-check 
  the option to snap. There are a few rules you need to follow: Your last point 
  must always connect back to your first point. No lines can ever intersect. No 
  two points can be closer than one grid unit. You have a maximum of 16 points 
  to use. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">There are also a few other options you'll see here. If 
  you don't want to plot points by hand, you can use the automatic shape tools 
  for circular and rectangular bot shapes. My example here is a rectangle, but 
  I plotted the points by hand, anyway. </p>
<P></P>
<IMG height=330 alt="" 
src="images/basic/workshop_chassis2.jpg" width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">In step 2, the baseplate shape that you drew has been 
  extruded into 3D space. The smaller window on the right shows a preview of your 
  chassis. Use your right-mouse button to click and drag in this view to rotate 
  it. You still have a blueprint for this step, but now you are editing the <I>top</I> 
  panel of the chassis. You can't draw a new shape here, you can only select points 
  and move them to a new position. This lets you create slanted panels or other 
  modified chassis shapes. Again you have some restrictions about intersecting 
  lines. You don't have to edit the top panel, if you want the sides of your bot 
  to go straight up, just leave the top outline identical to the bottom one. In 
  my example here, I have dragged two of the points back along the chassis length 
  to make a wedge-shape in the front of the chassis. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Also in step 2, you set the height of your chassis. Use 
  the slider on the right side of the screen to adjust how high you want your 
  top panel to be. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">When you are finished editing points and are satisfied 
  with the height, click the <B>Finished</B> button. Remember, once you start 
  adding components to this chassis, you can't change its shape, so be sure you 
  are happy with it at this point. </p>
<H5 class="tutorial_heading">Selecting Armor</H5>
<IMG height=330 alt="" 
src="images/basic/workshop_armor.jpg" width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">After you have built a chassis, the Armor button will 
  be available. Clicking it gives you a choice between four armor types: Polymer, 
  Aluminum, Titanium, and Steel. Each type has a strength and a weight. You might 
  want a lighter weight material for your robot to make a certain weight class 
  or to drive faster. Or, if you aren't concerned about weight and speed, you 
  can pick the heavier materials which will give your robot more protection. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">There is a checkbox here to "use default chassis appearance" 
  when selecting your armor. If this is checked, when you pick an armor type, 
  your chassis appearance will be modified to look like that particular armor. 
  If you would prefer to paint the chassis surface yourself, you can uncheck this 
  option and your chassis appearance will not be changed. You will always be setting 
  the weight and strength of your chassis; this option simply lets you texture 
  your chassis automatically or not. </p>
<H4 class="tutorial_heading">Components</H4>
<IMG height=330 alt="" 
src="images/basic/workshop_components.jpg" width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Now that you have your chassis created, you can start 
  to place components in it. After selecting the <B>Components</B> choice from 
  the top menu, you will see a semi-transparent view of your chassis. This lets 
  you see the shape of your bot, but also place components inside of it. Remember 
  how to rotate your view? Drag your right-mouse button in the 3D viewing area. 
  Mousewheel zooms in and out. You will frequently need to adjust your view in 
  order to accurately place a component. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">You will see several categories of components in the 
  upper right: </p>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI class="tutorial_body">Power - Batteries, air tanks and your control board 
    are in this category. 
    
  <LI class="tutorial_body">Extenders - Extenders are generic shapes that can 
    be connected together to help position the weapons or other parts of your 
    robot 
  <LI class="tutorial_body">Mechanics - Moveable components are included in this 
    category. Motors and pistons of various sorts are found here. 
  <LI class="tutorial_body">Treads - Wheels of all sizes. 
  <LI class="tutorial_body">Weapons - Heavy-duty components used to inflict pain 
    on an opponent! 
  <LI class="tutorial_body">Extras - Items not fitting into other categories end 
    up here. You'll find ballast weights, wedges, and other odds and ends. </LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">This tutorial won't cover all of the various components. 
  You will learn more about some of them in the mobility and mechanics tutorials.</p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Clicking any of the category icons will show you a list 
  of components. This list scrolls from left to right. Selecting any component 
  in the list shows you a preview and description. The preview window has some 
  green attachment points that you can select to help place the component. Don't 
  worry about that for now. We'll just use the default points for this tutorial. 
</p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Every robot needs to have a control board. This is the 
  first component in the Power category. Select it and press the <B>Attach</B> 
  button to begin the process of attaching. Just click it, no need to click and 
  drag. The component will appear in the 3D view at the position of your mouse. 
  Move your mouse around and you'll see the control board move, too. Now move 
  your mouse overtop the baseplate of your chassis. The control board aligns itself 
  to the baseplate showing you that it can be placed there. (Remember to rotate 
  your view with your right-mouse button if you need a better angle to see the 
  chassis baseplate. You will still be in attachment mode even while rotating 
  the view.) To drop the control board on the baseplate, just click your left 
  mouse button. The control board must be completely inside the chassis in order 
  to be dropped. If it is intersecting with a wall of the chassis, it will appear 
  red, meaning it is not in a valid position. </p>

<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Pretty easy, huh? But what if you wanted to rotate the 
  direction that the component faces? It doesn't really matter which way the control 
  board faces, but a motor would need to be aligned properly. Let's try it with 
  a motor. Click the <B>Mechanics</B> category and select the Redbird Spin Motor. 
  Click the Attach button and drag it onto the baseplate. It defaults to facing 
  one direction, but you might want the axle to point a different way. While the 
  motor is over the baseplate, hold the <B>Shift</B> key and move your mouse. 
  Aha! It rotates to face any direction. When you have it aligned the way you 
  want, release the shift key and you can continue to move it around in its new 
  orientation. Find a nice spot for it, and click the left mouse to drop it. Notice 
  in my example that I positioned the motor so that the axle passes through the 
  chassis. Axles are allowed to do this, but the body of the motor is not. You'll 
  soon learn which components are allowed to pass through the chassis walls and 
  which ones are not. </p>

<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Wait, it gets better! What if you want something placed 
  higher up in the chassis? In other words, you don't want it placed flush to 
  the baseplate, but instead want it raised up a few inches. Simply hold the <B>CTRL</B> 
  key down and the component can be raised up off of the baseplate. You'll definitely 
  need to get proficient at changing your view to do an action like this. You'll 
  find that you start with a top down view, choose a location on the baseplate, 
  rotate your view to the side, then hold CTRL and raise it up and drop it. A 
  bit tricky for beginners, but you'll quickly learn to do it. It is particularly 
  useful when you are out of space on your baseplate and want to position a control 
  board above another component. Or if you are placing a weapon motor or piston 
  and don't want it to be at the lowest position in your chassis. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">So let's get back to placing components. So far you have 
  a control board and a motor. Now let's add something for the motor to spin. 
  The easiest thing for now is a wheel. Click the <B>Treads</B> category and pick 
  the N12 Wheel. Click the Attach button and move your mouse over the Red Bird 
  motor that you placed. The wheel pops onto the end of the axle. Wheels automatically 
  know that they are allowed to attach only to axles. You might notice that you 
  can't place a wheel on the baseplate of the chassis the way you can place motors 
  or the control board. </p>
<P></P>
<IMG height=330 alt="" src="images/basic/ws_wheel.jpg" 
width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">For the sake of keeping this tutorial short, we'll just 
  add one more component and then move on to other things. To power your motor, 
  you'll need a battery. In the Power category, pick the Nifty 6V Battery and 
  place it anywhere on the baseplate. </p>
<H4 class="tutorial_heading">Wiring</H4>
<p class="tutorial_body">Since you have a control board and a motor, you can wire 
  your robot. If you didn't have the control board you couldn't do any wiring. 
  And if you didn't have the motor, you would be able to do wiring, but would 
  have no components needing it! </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Click the <B>Wiring</B> button on the top menu. The wiring 
  panel shows the same transparent 3D view, as well as a blank robot controller. 
  You can set up your controller however you like. You will see a grid of empty 
  slots on your controller and three different control types at the top of the 
  screen. </p>
<P></P>
<UL>
  <LI class="tutorial_body">A <B>Switch</B> is a control that toggles power On 
    and Off every time you use it. 
    
  <LI class="tutorial_body">A <B>Button</B> will give power to a component while 
    the button is pressed, and will turn off power when the button is released. 
    It is also used to trigger components needing instant input, such as a burst 
    motor. 
  <LI class="tutorial_body">An <B>Analog Control</B> is a control that provides 
        variable power to a component. Using a keyboard input device, the analog 
        control can only send full positive 100% or negative 100% signals. With 
        a joystick or gamepad with analog input, you can use the sensitivity of 
        the input device to send partial power to a component. Analog controls 
        are particularly useful for motors that need to spin in two different 
        directions. The positive input can power the motor in the clockwise direction, 
        and the negative input can power it in the counterclockwise direction. 
      </LI>
    </UL>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">It's best to think through what you want to do with your 
  robot, then build an appropriate controller. In our example here, we have only 
  one motor with a wheel attached. Let's build a simple controller to drive that 
  wheel in one direction. Click and drag a <B>Button Control</B> from the three 
  choices onto an empty slot on the controller. </p>
<P></P>
<IMG height=330 alt="" 
src="images/basic/ws_wiring_control.jpg" width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">As soon as you drop the control, you get a window asking 
  for more information. You can give this control a name to help you remember 
  what it does. It could be something like "drive forward", or "trigger weapon", 
  or whatever you like. You don't need to give it a name if you can remember what 
  it does. </p>
<P></P>
<IMG height=191 alt="" 
src="images/basic/ws_wiring_input.jpg" width=300> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">You also need to assign an input to the controller. Click 
  the rectangular field next to the "Button on/off" label and select a key on 
  your keyboard that will activate this button. My example uses the <B>W</B> key. 
  You could also hilight the field and press one of the buttons on a joystick 
  or gamepad if you prefer. Click OK when you are finished. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Ok, so you now have a button control set up on your robot 
  controller. You also have decided that the W key will activate it (or whichever 
  key you chose). But it still is not wired to anything on your robot. With the 
  button control selected (shows a blue border around the controller slot), click 
  on the motor that you attached to the robot. A new window appears asking you 
  to decide how this control will be wired to this motor. </p>
<P></P>
<IMG height=210 alt="" 
src="images/basic/ws_wiring_motorCW.jpg" width=300> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">The spin motor gives you two options in the drop-down 
  list for how this control might be wired. The button can either make the motor 
  spin clockwise or spin counterclockwise. Pick either one for this example. I 
  selected clockwise. Click OK when you are done. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">That's it for wiring. You have chosen a control type, 
  assigned a key to it, and wired it to your motor. Obviously most robots have 
  more than one motor, and many also have more than one control wired to each 
  motor. But for this example, we should be able to see how it is working. Click 
  on the <B>Test Robot</B> button at the top of the screen.</p>
<P></P>
<IMG height=330 alt="" 
src="images/basic/ws_testbot.jpg" width=440> 
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">You now see your robot in the test garage. (Every good 
  workshop has an area to test the robot. You know...beat up some 50 gallon drums 
  or a pile of cinderblocks.) Go ahead and press the key you assigned (example 
  used "W"). You should see the motor turn on, which spins the wheel and makes 
  the bot start moving around in circles. Pretty much impossible to drive, of 
  course, with only one wheel that can only go one direction. But you get the 
  point. The next tutorial will go into more detail on ways to build and wire 
  your bot for driving. </p>
<P></P>
<p class="tutorial_body">Congratulations! Go back to the Overview screen, give 
  your bot a name and take a snapshot. It's pretty much a useless piece of junk, 
  but you made it, so nice job! </p>
